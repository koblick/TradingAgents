Based on the provided investment plan and rationale, I concur with the aggressive trimming recommendation. The valuation metrics, insider selling patterns, and competitive threats present clear downside risks that outweigh the bullish growth narrative. Historical parallels (e.g., Meta 2021) further reinforce the need for caution.  

### Key Actionable Insights:  
1. **Valuation Risk**: Current multiples demand unsustainable growth, mirroring past bubble setups.  
2. **Catalysts for Downside**: Cloud capex slowdown and competition (e.g., Google TPUs) are near-term threats.  
3. **Strategic Exit**: Phased selling mitigates regret while locking in gains.  

### Final Decision:  
Execute the proposed phased exit plan immediately, reallocating to diversified AI exposure and hedges.  

**FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: SELL** (Trim 50% now, stop-loss on remainder, and hedge with puts).
